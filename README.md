# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi there! I'm Luca, and this README serves as a container of information about who I am and what I do here.

# About Me

I'm a Bachelor's student in Economics and Finance based in Italy, deeply passionate about financial markets and asset management. I've always had a keen interest in technology as well, and one way I've found to merge both finance and tech is through the development of projects, leveraging tools like Excel and Python (which I'm currently learning).

# Interests and Projects

The projects I've worked on and continue to pursue revolve around my personal interests in portfolio management, fixed income securities, and the valuation and trading of derivatives.

# Additional Information

Apart from my academic and professional interests, I also enjoy:
- Playing chess (mostly online on Lichess, few times OTB)
- Football (supporter of FC Barcelona)
- Traveling (I've been to 10+ countries)
- Geography
